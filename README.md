# Compsoc Website 2017 API

A Node backend for the Compsoc Edinburgh website for 2017

## Running server

Just run `yarn install` followed by `yarn start` to start a copy of the ExpressJS server.

For development the `yarn run start-watch` script may be handy as it uses Nodemon.io to watch
for changes to the server source and reload the application automatically.
